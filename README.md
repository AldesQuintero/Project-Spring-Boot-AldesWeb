# Spring Boot Project

## Description
This project is a demonstration of my ability to create a web application using Spring Boot. The main goal was to explore and apply the functionalities that Spring Boot offers, such as dependency injection, template management, and creating a coherent project structure. This project uses HTML templates to render the user interface, thus demonstrating the integration of frontend technologies within a Spring Boot environment.

## Requirements
Java 22.0.1
Apache Maven 3.9.7
Spring Boot 3.2.7

## Note on Spring Boot Version
We chose to use Spring Boot version 3.2.7 for this project because version 3.3.1 had compatibility issues, such as not detecting classes and other features. Therefore, to ensure the stability and functionality of the project, it was decided to maintain version 3.2.7.

## Installation and Execution
Instructions on how to clone the repository and run the application:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/AldesQuintero/Spring-Boot-Project-AldesWeb
cd Spring-Boot-Project-AldesWeb
mvn clean install
